# DECISIONS — savoycapital

Record real, load-bearing decisions here: **what + why + date.** The bar is "someone would
otherwise re-litigate this" — not every choice, just the ones that cost something to
reopen. Read the headers before working in an area.

Newest first.

- **theAPlink's multi-tenancy does not carry over (owner + reading of the brief, 2026-08-23).**
  Savoy Capital is **one fund with multiple investments and two authenticated users**, not a
  multi-tenant product. theAPlink's `Group → Company → Store` hierarchy, per-model
  `companyId` scoping, tenancy Prisma extension, and `check:tenant-scoping` ratchet all exist
  to serve 15–30 companies; none of them has a counterpart here. **Do not import them, and do
  not apply theAPlink's governing design test ("what does adding client #27 cost?")** — it
  is the right question for that product and the wrong one for this.
  - **What this does not license:** skipping authorization. Two users still means the private
    portfolio surface must be genuinely closed to the public one. "Only two people use it" is
    an argument against tenancy machinery, never against an auth boundary.
  - **The thing that does scale here is the investment count, and time.** The portfolio is
    monitored *over time*, so history is a first-class modeling concern from the first
    schema — see `FACTS.md`.

- **Design is carried from theAPlink verbatim, not re-derived (owner, 2026-08-23).**
  `design/` is byte-identical to theAPlink's, including its `AP_`-prefixed filename and its
  AP-domain exemplars. The alternative — extracting a "clean" brand-neutral subset — was not
  taken, because the value of the folder is that it is the *same* look, and a subset drifts
  the moment someone judges what's essential. Read the exemplars for structure; their
  subject matter is theAPlink's and means nothing here.
  - **What did NOT carry:** theAPlink's app code, Prisma schema and 134 migrations, the ten
    `scripts/` guardrail linters and their baselines, `.github/` workflows, `.claude/` hooks
    and rules, `docs/`, and the accumulated `.claudet/` content (LOG, DECISIONS, scoping
    audits). Structure carried; history did not.
  - **Consequence to remember:** `npm run lint:design` — the gate that makes "source of
    truth" true in theAPlink rather than aspirational — does not exist here. Until it does,
    the mirror rule is a convention held by hand, and `design/README.md` says so plainly.
